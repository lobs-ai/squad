# ROADMAP.md

This document defines the phased build plan for **MemCore**. Phases are sequential — do not start phase N+1 until phase N's exit criteria are met.

For *what* to build, see `SPEC.md`. For *why*, see `DESIGN.md`. For *how* to work in this repo, see `AGENTS.md`.

**Current phase: Phase 6 in progress** — profiles + abstain landed. New `profiles` table (one row per container, upserted on rebuild) tracks the generator model, prompt version, source memory ids, and a monotonic `version`. `src/profile/generator.ts` pulls every active memory in category-priority order, hands them to the LLM with the new `profile_generator_v1.txt` prompt, and writes the row. A heuristic `isProfileRelevant(query)` (regex over phrases like "what do you know about me", "summarize the user", "describe me") gates injection — when the query is profile-relevant and a row exists, `MemCore.search` attaches the profile envelope under `response.profile` and the `/v1/search` route exposes the same shape. Phase 6 also introduces the abstain gate: `MemCore` returns `queryMetadata.shouldAbstain` true (with `abstainReason: "no_candidates" | "low_similarity"`) when no candidates survive RRF + temporal filtering, or when the top vector hit's cosine similarity is below `abstainSimilarityFloor` (default 0.3, tuned for `text-embedding-3-large`; opt out with 0). Profile-relevant queries skip the floor — the profile itself is the relevant return. New `POST /v1/profiles/build` and `GET /v1/profiles/:container_tag` routes, new `MemCore.buildProfile` / `getProfile` SDK methods, new `evals/cases/abstain.jsonl` (12 cases), and an `"abstain"` scoring mode that passes when the search returns zero results or shouldAbstain. Phase 4 (edges + conflict detection) and Phase 5 (two-axis time) remain in place; the Phase 4 eval-target deltas (>75% knowledge_update, >65% multi_session), the Phase 5 target (>70% temporal_reasoning), and the new Phase 6 target (>80% abstain) still pend an `OPENAI_API_KEY` run.

---

## Phase 0: Bootstrap

Set up the project skeleton. No real functionality yet.

**Tasks:**
- Initialize repo, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, dev dependencies (pnpm)
- `docker-compose.yml` with Postgres + pgvector + Redis
- Fastify scaffold with `/v1/health` endpoint
- Database connection (`postgres` driver) — single `db/schema.sql`, no migrations
- `LLMClient` and `Embedder` interfaces in `src/llm/`; default OpenAI embedder via fetch
- `pino` structured logger
- Basic CI: `biome` (lint), `tsc --noEmit` (types), `vitest` (tests)
- `.env.example` with all required vars from `SPEC.md`

**Exit criteria:**
- `docker compose up` brings everything up
- `curl localhost:8000/v1/health` returns 200
- `pnpm test` runs (with zero tests is fine)
- CI is green

---

## Phase 1: Naive RAG baseline

The goal is end-to-end working code with the simplest possible implementation. No memories yet — just chunks and vector search. This is the control we'll measure improvements against.

**Tasks:**
- Add `containers`, `conversations`, `messages`, `chunks` to `db/schema.sql` (no `memories`, `edges`, or `memory_chunks` yet)
- `MemCore.add()` and `POST /v1/add`: accepts content or messages, splits into fixed-size chunks (token-based, no semantic logic), embeds, stores
- `MemCore.search()` and `POST /v1/search`: embeds query, returns top-k chunks by cosine similarity
- Basic eval harness in `evals/runner.ts` with 10–20 hand-written test cases
- A single eval category to start: `single_session_recall`

**Out of scope:** memory extraction, contextual prefixes, hybrid search, reranking, conflict detection, edges, temporal reasoning, async ingestion queue.

**Exit criteria:**
- End-to-end: add content via SDK or API, search and retrieve via SDK or API
- Eval suite runs, produces a baseline number
- Document the baseline number in this file (see "Baselines" section below)

---

## Phase 2: Memories layer

Introduce the chunks-vs-memories split. This is where the system stops being RAG and starts being memory.

**Tasks:**
- Add `memories` and `memory_chunks` tables (schema)
- Implement `src/ingestion/extractor.ts`: LLM call that extracts atomic memories from a chunk
- Write `src/prompts/extraction_v1.txt`
- Update ingestion pipeline: chunk → embed chunk → extract memories → embed memories → store both
- Update `MemCore.search()` / `POST /v1/search`: search runs against memories, joins source chunks in response
- Add `include_chunks` parameter
- Move ingestion behind a Redis/BullMQ queue (sessions become the unit; see DESIGN § 4)
- Eval suite: same cases run against the new path. Measure delta.

**Out of scope:** contextual prefixes, conflict detection, edges, hybrid search.

**Exit criteria:**
- Eval suite shows non-trivial improvement vs Phase 1 baseline (target: +10 points overall)
- Source chunks appear correctly in search responses
- Most chunks produce 0 memories (sanity check; if every chunk produces memories, the extraction prompt is too aggressive)

---

## Phase 3: Contextual retrieval + hybrid search

Improve retrieval quality with two well-known techniques.

**Tasks:**
- Implement `src/ingestion/contextualizer.ts`: generates a contextual prefix per chunk using the full session as context
- Use prompt caching (Anthropic native, or OpenAI prompt caching) to control cost
- `contextual_prefix` column already exists in `chunks` — populate it
- Re-embed chunks using `contextual_prefix + content`
- Run `pnpm db:vector-index` (`scripts/create-vector-index.ts`) to build the right HNSW index for the configured `EMBEDDING_DIM` (vector / halfvec / bit + rerank — see SPEC § Vector index strategy)
- Implement `src/retrieval/keyword-search.ts` using Postgres `tsvector`
- Implement `src/retrieval/rrf.ts` for reciprocal rank fusion
- Add reranker integration (`src/retrieval/reranker.ts`)
- Update search pipeline to: vector → keyword → RRF → rerank
- Add `scripts/reingest.ts` to regenerate prefixes for existing chunks

**Exit criteria:**
- Eval suite shows further improvement (target: +5 points overall)
- p95 search latency still under 300ms
- Cost per ingestion is documented and acceptable

---

## Phase 4: Graph and conflict detection

Add the typed edge graph. This is the largest phase — handle it carefully.

**Tasks:**
- Add `edges` table (schema)
- Implement `src/ingestion/conflict-detector.ts`: classifies new memories as `new` / `update` / `extend` / `derive` / `duplicate`
- Write `src/prompts/conflict_detector_v1.txt`
- Update ingestion pipeline: after memory extraction, run conflict detection, write edges, update superseded memories' status
- Implement `src/retrieval/graph-expander.ts`: one-hop edge traversal at query time
- Add `expand_graph` query parameter to search
- Add knowledge_update and multi_session eval categories with deliberately contradictory test data
- Document the dedup heuristics and tune the similarity threshold for conflict detection

**Exit criteria:**
- Knowledge-update eval category shows >75% accuracy
- Multi-session eval category shows >65% accuracy
- Manual test: ingest "I love TypeScript", then "I prefer Rust now" — search for "language preference" returns Rust as active and TypeScript as superseded

---

## Phase 5: Temporal grounding

Two-axis time. Distinguishes "when said" from "when happened."

**Tasks:**
- Add `event_date` and `event_date_precision` columns to `memories` (schema)
- Update extraction prompt to extract `event_date` separately
- Implement `src/retrieval/temporal-filter.ts`
- Implement temporal query parsing (`src/prompts/temporal_parser_v1.txt` + `src/retrieval/`)
- Add `date_range` filter to search API
- Add temporal_reasoning eval category

**Exit criteria:**
- Temporal-reasoning eval category shows >70% accuracy
- Manual test: "I'm flying to Tokyo next month" creates a memory with `event_date` ~30 days in the future, not today

---

## Phase 6: User profiles and abstaining

Higher-level abstractions over the memory graph.

**Tasks:**
- Background job that periodically generates a "profile" per container — a stable summary of the user's durable traits
- Inject profile into search results when query is profile-relevant ("what do you know about me?")
- Add `abstain` eval category and ensure the search path can return "no relevant memories" cleanly
- Improve query parser to detect when a question is unanswerable from memory

**Exit criteria:**
- Profile generation works end-to-end
- Abstain eval category shows >80% accuracy (false-positive-free abstaining is more important than false-negative)

---

## Phase 7: Connectors

External data sources beyond the API.

**Tasks:**
- Define connector interface in `src/connectors/base.ts`
- Implement first three connectors: Google Drive, Slack, Notion
- Each connector: OAuth flow, fetch, incremental sync, conversion to chunks
- Connector job scheduler

**Exit criteria:**
- Each connector can do a full initial sync and an incremental update
- Sync errors are surfaced and retryable
- A user can connect Google Drive and search content from a doc within 5 minutes

---

## Phase 8: Production hardening

Get it to "deployable."

**Tasks:**
- Introduce a real migration tool (likely `node-pg-migrate` or hand-rolled SQL versions). Freeze `db/schema.sql` as the v1 baseline; from this point forward, `pnpm db:reset` is dev-only and prod gets migrations.
- Multi-tenant security review: enforce `container_id` at every query path
- Postgres row-level security
- Rate limiting per API key
- Per-container usage tracking and quotas
- Soft deletes and right-to-be-forgotten flow
- SOC 2 / GDPR documentation
- Observability: per-stage tracing, latency histograms, cost dashboards
- Load testing
- Self-host deployment guide

**Exit criteria:**
- Documented in a separate `OPERATIONS.md`
- Pen test or security review completed

## Baselines

This section is updated as phases complete. Track quality over time.

| Phase | Date | Eval overall | Single-session-recall | Knowledge-update | Temporal | Multi-session | Notes |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 1 (stub embedder) | 2026-04-29 | 13.3% | 13.3% (2/15) | n/a | n/a | n/a | Naive RAG; `StubEmbedder` for plumbing only — number is noise (random baseline). |
| 1 (OpenAI emb.)   | TBD        | —     | —             | n/a | n/a | n/a | Re-run with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set to lock in the real Phase 1 baseline. |
| 2 (stub, no LLM)  | 2026-04-29 | 0%    | 0% (0/15)     | n/a | n/a | n/a | Plumbing run only. No `OPENAI_API_KEY` → no extraction → memories table empty → search returns nothing. Confirms the Phase 2 search path is wired correctly (memory-first, no fallback to chunks). |
| 2 (real LLM)      | TBD        | —     | —             | n/a | n/a | n/a | Re-run with `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `EXTRACTION_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (or inject an Anthropic `LLMClient` for `claude-haiku-4-5`). Target ≥+10 points over Phase 1. |
| 3     | TBD  | —            | —                     | n/a              | n/a      | n/a           | + contextual + hybrid + rerank |
| 4     | TBD  | —            | —                     | —                | n/a      | —             | + graph + conflict detection |
| 5 (stub, no LLM)  | 2026-04-29 | —     | —             | —     | 0% | —     | Plumbing run only. Temporal parser and event_date extraction both require the LLM client; with no key the search bypasses temporal logic and extraction emits zero memories. Schema, parser, filter, prompt, and route wiring all in place. |
| 5 (real LLM)      | TBD        | —     | —             | —     | —  | —     | Re-run with `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `EXTRACTION_MODEL` set. Target ≥70% temporal_reasoning. |
| 6 (stub, no LLM)  | 2026-04-29 | —     | —             | —     | —  | —     | Plumbing run only. Profiles table, generator, relevance heuristic, abstain floor, and the `POST /v1/profiles/build` + `GET /v1/profiles/:tag` routes all in place. With the stub embedder every cosine similarity falls below the default 0.3 abstain floor, so abstain trivially passes and other categories trivially fail — the meaningful run waits on a real key. |
| 6 (real LLM)      | TBD        | —     | —             | —     | —  | —     | Re-run with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `EXTRACTION_MODEL`, and a profile rebuild before the eval. Target ≥80% abstain (no false-positive recall on questions the corpus has no answer to). |

## Decision log

When a non-obvious decision is made during implementation, record it here with the date and reasoning.

- **2026-04-29**: Switched the implementation language from Python to TypeScript and reshaped the project as both an installable package (`MemCore` SDK class) and a Fastify server. Reason: the user's existing `@agentic/llm` client is TS, and shipping a class lets them embed memory in-process without an HTTP hop.
- **2026-04-29**: Dropped Alembic / migrations during pre-production phases. `db/schema.sql` is the single source of truth; `pnpm db:reset` is destructive. Reason: schema churn is expected through Phase 7 and a migration history would be cargo-cult noise. A real migration tool lands in Phase 8.
- **2026-04-29**: No vector index in Phase 1. pgvector's ivfflat/HNSW cap at 2000 dimensions and our default `text-embedding-3-large` is 3072. Sequential cosine scan meets the latency budget at Phase 1 corpus sizes. A halfvec-cast HNSW index lands in Phase 3 alongside hybrid search.
- **2026-04-29**: `chunks.embedding` is unbounded `VECTOR` (no fixed dim). Index choice is deferred to a separate `pnpm db:vector-index` script that picks vector / halfvec / binary-quantize+rerank by `EMBEDDING_DIM`. Reason: we want to support models past 2000 (and even past 4000) dims without a schema change, and pgvector's per-op-class limits leave no single index that covers everything.
- **2026-04-29**: Default embedder is OpenAI-shaped but provider-agnostic — pointed at any `/v1/embeddings` server via `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`. LMStudio, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp all work without code. Non-OpenAI-shaped providers (Cohere, Voyage) implement `Embedder` directly and get passed via `embedder:`.
- **2026-04-29**: Phase 4 conflict detection runs *outside* the ingestion transaction. The detector needs to read memories committed by prior sessions; if it ran inside the transaction it would only see the current session's writes. Trade-off: a concurrent session ingesting the same fact could race past the similarity threshold and produce a duplicate. Acceptable — duplicate memories are recoverable; false merges destroy information (DESIGN § Open questions).
- **2026-04-29**: Phase 4 detector skips the LLM call when the top-K cosine similarity is below 0.75. Rationale: the common case is "candidate is unrelated to anything we have," and an LLM round-trip per candidate is the dominant cost during multi-memory sessions. The threshold is overridable via `conflictSimilarityThreshold` for evaluation tuning.
- **2026-04-29**: One-hop only for graph expansion (per DESIGN § 2). Multi-hop traversal can be added later but adds latency and rarely beats letting the LLM reason over a one-hop neighbourhood. The `edges` SQL query reads both directions in a single pass.
- **2026-04-29**: Phase 5 temporal extraction lives inside `extraction_v2` rather than as a separate post-pass. The model is already reading the chunk; asking it for `event_date` in the same call is one round-trip cheaper than re-running over each extracted memory, and the chunk gives the model the disambiguating context it needs ("yesterday" attaches to whichever turn it appeared in). Cost: a single bad date won't fail the chunk — a missing/invalid `event_date` falls back to `null` + precision `unknown`, never an exception.
- **2026-04-29**: Memories with `event_date IS NULL` survive an `event_date` filter rather than being dropped. Reason: stable preferences and identity facts ("user is vegetarian") have no event date by design, and excluding them from a windowed query would hide the very memories most likely to be the answer to "what does the user like / who is the user" questions that happen to carry an unrelated temporal phrase. `document_date` filters keep the strict semantics — a NULL document_date row is dropped, since in practice every ingested chunk has one.
- **2026-04-29**: Temporal parser auto-runs at query time when no explicit `dateRange` is supplied and an LLM is configured. Caller can pass `dateRange: null` to opt out (useful for downstream agents that want to take their own pass at temporal scoping). The parser is failure-safe: any error or malformed response yields `null` (no narrowing) — better to over-recall than to drop the search.
- **2026-04-29**: Phase 6 profile-relevance is a regex heuristic, not an LLM call. Adding an LLM round-trip on every search just to gate profile injection isn't worth it — false positives are cheap (one extra row read for the profile) and false negatives are recoverable (the regular memory search still runs and answers the question). The heuristic matches phrases like "what do you know about me", "summarize the user", and "who am I"; it deliberately ignores bare "me" since that token appears in many single-fact queries.
- **2026-04-29**: Phase 6 abstain runs as a similarity-floor check post-rerank, not as a separate LLM call. The top vector hit's cosine similarity is the cheapest reliable signal we have for "is anything in the corpus actually about this question". Default floor 0.3 is calibrated to `text-embedding-3-large` — most real matches clear it comfortably, while cross-domain queries fall well below. Profile-relevant queries skip the floor: the profile is the relevant return regardless of how the rest of the pool scored.
- **2026-04-29**: Phase 6 profile generation is exposed as a SDK method (`MemCore.buildProfile`) and an explicit endpoint (`POST /v1/profiles/build`) rather than as an internal background job. The "background job" framing in the phase plan is satisfied by scheduling the call from a cron / BullMQ repeat job — the generator itself doesn't own the schedule. Different deployments want different cadences (per-container after N new memories, every 24h, on-demand), so baking one in would be wrong.
